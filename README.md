# Chat Bot

The assignment was to create a chat bot to learn the basics in JavaScript. I created a basic chat bot at a medical center for users to book an appointment or to get in touch with a nurse.

## The problem

The starting template for the project had a HTML and CSS, and a foundation of JavaScript. I only added JavaScript-code, using JavaScript DOM. I started out by creating a flow chart. This project has a lot of room for improvement. If I had more time I would add more options for the user to choose, e.g. to reschedule an appointment and so on. The code should be more dry, using conditionals. The event listeners should all be in one place.
