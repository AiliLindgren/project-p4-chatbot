# Chat Bot

The assignment was to create a chat bot to learn the basics in JavaScript. I created a basic chat bot at a medical center for users to book an appointment or to get in touch with a nurse.

## The problem

The starting template for the project had the HTML and the CSS done, and a foundation of JavaScript. I only added JavaScript-code, using JavaScript DOM. I started out by creating a flow chart. This project has a lot of room for improvement. The code should be more dry, using conditionals. If I had more time I would also add more options for the user to choose, e.g. to reschedule an appointment and so on.
